A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
This project outlines the steps to building a simple Hangman game which takes a random unknown word from a preset word list.
The game takes in a player's guess for a letter which is in the unknown word. If the letter is in the word, the player makes another guess until the word is completed.
If the letter is not in the word, the player loses a life. Once the player completes the word or loses all their lives, the player wins or loses the game, respectively.
