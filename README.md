<p>A description of the project:</br>
This project outlines the steps to building a simple Hangman game which takes a random unknown word from a preset word list. </br>
The game takes in a player's guess for a letter which is in the unknown word. If the letter is in the word, the player makes another guess until the word is completed. </br>
If the letter is not in the word, the player loses a life. Once the player completes the word or loses all their lives, the player wins or loses the game, respectively. </p>
